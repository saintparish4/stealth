# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Stealth (the scanner or this repository), please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly** until it has been addressed.
2. **Open a GitHub Security Advisory** (preferred):
   - Go to this repository on GitHub.
   - Click **Security** → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.
   - Describe the issue, steps to reproduce, impact, and any mitigation ideas.
3. We will acknowledge your report and respond as soon as possible. If the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure.

## Disclosure

We will release a patch for confirmed vulnerabilities as soon as practical. After a fix is released, we may disclose the issue publicly (e.g. in release notes or an advisory). If 90 days pass without a fix, we may still disclose to allow the community to take action.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of Stealth is supported with security updates. We recommend upgrading to the newest version.
