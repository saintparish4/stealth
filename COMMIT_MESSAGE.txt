feat: Expand to 13 detectors with improved accuracy and code organization

Major update expanding vulnerability detection from 7 to 13 comprehensive
detectors, fixing duplicate detection issues, eliminating false positives,
and improving code organization.

## New Detectors Added

- Integer Overflow/Underflow: Detects unsafe arithmetic in Solidity <0.8
  and unchecked blocks
- Flash Loan Vulnerability: Identifies price manipulation patterns and
  unvalidated callbacks
- Storage Collision (Proxy): Detects missing storage gaps and unprotected
  initializers in upgradeable contracts
- Front-Running Susceptibility: Catches missing slippage protection,
  approval race conditions, and front-runnable auctions
- DoS via Unbounded Loops: Detects gas griefing patterns and external
  calls in loops
- Unchecked ERC20 Return Values: Flags missing SafeERC20 usage

## Improvements

### Detection Accuracy
- Fixed duplicate detection in tx.origin and unsafe randomness detectors
- Eliminated false positives for user functions (stake, deposit, claim, etc.)
- Enhanced slippage detection for withdraw functions using price calculations
- Added _transfer() detection in loops for internal ERC20 transfers
- Improved approve() front-running detection with better pattern matching

### Code Organization
- Organized code with clear section headers (// ============================================================================)
- Consolidated heuristics module into main.rs for better maintainability
- Added comprehensive inline documentation for all detector sections

### Test Coverage
- Added new-detectors-test.sol with comprehensive test cases
- Added production-governance-token.sol demonstrating mixed vulnerability patterns
- Added production-staking-vault.sol (clean reference implementation)
- Added production-yield-aggregator.sol (hidden vulnerabilities example)

## Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with all 13 detectors and new features
- Updated PRODUCTION-CONTRACTS.md with accurate scan results
- Added guidance for addressing detected patterns

## Technical Details

- Detectors now check at appropriate AST node levels to avoid duplicates
- User function exclusion list prevents false positives on legitimate patterns
- Enhanced pattern matching for slippage protection in price-based withdrawals
- Improved array iteration detection for unbounded loop patterns

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Files Changed

- core/src/main.rs: Major refactor with 6 new detectors and improvements
- core/src/heuristics.rs: Deleted (consolidated into main.rs)
- README.md: Updated feature list and documentation
- core/contracts/PRODUCTION-CONTRACTS.md: Updated with accurate results
- Multiple test contract files: Updated and new test cases added
